Review:
- Array: are static, once they're created you can't change the amount of elements stored
- ArrayList: way more dynamic, add and remove as we please
- HashMap: key/value pair (similar to objects in JS)


Linked Lists
- they serve as a template for other data structures
- they consist of objects with references to other objects
- they are NOT indexed
- really keeps track of the first and last objects in its list
- objects in a LinkedList = Nodes


If LinkedLists are not indexed, how are we able to use methods like .get or .add() and specify an index?
	- When we run add() and get() and specific an index, the Linked List has to go through each Node in the List from start to finish until it gets to that specific location

Queues
	- First in, First out (FIFO)
	- Objects added to the back (Enqueuing) and removed from the front(Dequeuing)
	- type of LinkedList 

Stacks
	- Last in, first out (LIFO)
	- Adding to a Stack is called pushing and popping(removing)
